<h2>Character</h2>
We all have a character. Some are intense and serious, whereas others don't take life too seriously and keep it chill. I'm talking about core-characteristics. We all have them deep down in our behaviour. 
<br>
For example, I will most likely be shy and look judgemental when meeting new people. And my mind will always tell me when someone says something that is plainly wrong, however I have learned that I don't always have to mention it. I only do that when I don't care for being a jerk to someone. Mostly I tend to be kind, as I told in 'Everyone has a code'. 
<br><br>
Point is, everyone has a core character we show when we aren't aware of our behaviour. And a sad thing to see in life is seeing people change, because they become someone else. I often observe elder people return to their core character. Being bold and making dirty jokes, instead of being all professional. They become free. Free of greed and money. 
<br><br>
<h2>Money vs integrity</h2>
Some people change because of money, either chasing it blindly or thinking they are a superior kind because they earn or have a large sum of money. 
<br><br>
In my life I do not want to change my personality. Not for money and not with money. If an organisation offers me a job for $200k/year, but it is not (in my opinion) ethical, I will either not take it or take it and make sure the job doesn't happen. If I become broke, I will not do anything you want for money, and if I win the lottery I will share my wealth just like I have done in the past. I will not change my personality and neither should you! If money doesn't change you. You are successful.
<br><br>
<h2>Who are you</h2>
Many people are not aware of their core character and do not realise the behaviour they show. There are many ways to find out what type of person you are, both from the inside and the outside. One test I highly recommend is <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test" target= "_blank">16personalities</a>. This is a personality test and goes very in depth, but there are probably many other personality tests that suffice and will teach you more about yourself. You can even do a Harry Potter house test. 
<br><br>
One other way to learn who you are is going solo. Take a solo trip in any way, shape or form. Roadtrip, with a plane to another country, by train, go camping somewhere, or even just going for a big hike in nature nearby, without anything but your phone. And think, think about everything you can think of. Remarkable how many things we humans can think of. 
<br><br>
<h2>Attributes and cosmetics</h2>
First of all, you have to get into a special mindset. I absolutely love! I call it the 'the coolest you can be is yourself' mindset. Look at a picture of yourself. Realise how cool you are, how special. This is you, you might have some parts in your life you can improve, but either way you already made it this far in life. You can think, present, talk, listen, run, jump, swim, scream, make jokes, laugh and countless other things. Maybe there are a few things you are unable to do, but you can at least do most of them. 
<br><br>
I started realising how amazing I was, or any other person around me, when I added up all the things that made someone who they are. Strength, speed, intelligence, ambition, braveness, assertiveness. Just try it and all the incredible things will start stacking up. So don't be what you have, be what you are.
<br><br>
<h2>Why being yourself makes you 10x stronger</h2>
Two years ago I fell into what felt like a depression. Just for a short time. The key factor that played was that I wasn't being myself. I won't go into details, but it sucked. Even if you are not aware, your body will use a lot of energy to keep up a certain appearance that isn't you. When you take a step back and become genuine, you will feel and become 10x stronger, faster and more intelligent. 
<br><br>
Most of this article is, as you have seen, not scientifically backed in any way. But that is what I call, speaking your mind by asking yourself questions and trying to answer them, which will only add more questions to the table. This is the core of philosophy, I think. What do you think? 
<br><br>
<h2>Mentorship</h2>
I briefly want to mention the importance of mentorship. There are a lot of people who do not have mentorship (someone with experience who can guide you through a certain time). In my experience this has been super helpful. It is also something that shapes you and your future. 
<br><br> 
<h2>Learning through interaction</h2>
If you want to realise who you are, what you can do, why you would even do something. I can assure you, you have to do something practical. Like bake an egg, or start crafting a trophy for a pub-quiz (yes I did that with a friend. and it was a lot of fun to do actually). 
<br><br>
Put your shoes on, go outside and think. I think thinking is one of the most underrated practices in human society. Especially when practised outside in an unknown area. Impressions fuel ideas and without exploration you will stay at the same level of understanding. 
<br>
I firmly believe in this philosophy, as it states the logical: Before you can visualize something, you must have seen similar things or things that can theoretically be combined to become the 'something'. Take image learning as an example. I have not tested this for a while, but in the year 2025 you could only generate half full glasses of wine with AI. This was because the only wine images that ChatGPT had been given 'by scanning the internet' was either, wine bottles or half full glasses of wine (because you usually only fill a wine glass up to half of the glass). So it could only generate half full wine glasses. And I genuinely think that human thought does use the same way of image learning, however more complex, because we can imagine more fluid being poured into the glass, it doesn't matter if it is a wine glass or a half broken whisky glass. 
<br><br>
So going outside and interact with the physical world will give you more impressions that will in turn also give you more ideas. Keep that in mind if you ever want to level up your thinking and get more ideas.
