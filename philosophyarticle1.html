<h2>The code</h2>
We all share the trait of having a course of action when encountering something new or unexpected. Most people are unaware of their initial actions, which is why I'm writing this. 
<br><br>
Every now and then I realise this issue and think about the best, or most efficient, way to interact with the world. We all have a code, a course of action, and I wrote mine down. 
<ol>
<li>Safety</li>
<li>Calmness</li>
<li>Patience</li>
<li>Kindness</li>
<li>Be yourself</li>
<li>Take opportunities</li>
<li>Skepticism</li>
<li>Stay interested</li>
</ol>
In other words: be safe and stay calm, make sure to be patient and kind, if you're not yourself you will act wrongly and people will notice and distrust you, and in life there are lots of opportunities so take them, and before you believe anything, think about it again, and lastly you have to stay interested to learn new things. 
<br><br>
It's a long list for sure, but it helps me interact with the world in the most excellent way. Of course this code is not perfect, however I find it almost impenetrable, since you begin with safety and end with open and critical thinking. The code also depicts what actually matters. Many people are ashamed of themselves of how they look or find it awkward to talk to someone. This code or model gives you room to breathe and take you out of the fight or flight mode. If everything is safe of course. 
<br><br>
<h2>Every 7 years we shift mentally</h2>
Humans change mentally during their life spans. Ranging from 5 to 7 years per 'cycle'. I can comprehend the idea that our identities, awareness and conscience shifts through the years. Especially when we start interacting with different groups of people. I am however convinced that we keep our core-characteristics, such as laziness, overthinking, always asking why or being overly excited. 
<br><br>
One general trait of mindset shift is risk awareness. Young people tend to be overly risky, while older people get more cautious of various things. Simple key elements play a role in this. When you get older, your body becomes weaker (a sad, but hard truth), so you become careful when jumping and running if you even do it at all.
<br><br>
My moral mindset also shifts continuously throughout the year. I, of course, would never harm anyone for no reason other than my own safety. What does change is my sense of being humble and ambition. Most of the time I feel humble and that we should be as fair as possible to everyone around us. However sometimes my conscience rotates to a more competitive thought process. "Nothing is fair, life is hard. If I can do it, everyone can. Rich people get to be super wealthy from making unethical decisions and deals, so why shouldn't I?". It is a super competitive and rather unethical mindset, however in object terms, it is how life works. Don't hate the player, hate the game. That is why I love people who I can trust.

<h2>Wealth and fair chances</h2>
I do believe that everyone deserves a fair chance in life and what you do with that is your own decision. Sadly this is not the case, because rich get richer and poor stay relatively poor, unless they actively and ambitiously change that (which is incredibly hard). 
<br>Take compound interest for example. When a very rich parent gives their child 1 million to invest when they get 18. The investment will compound every year with roughly 7% interest, without touching it! That 7% is more than the average income of a US citizen (2025). Old money is very powerful. So help your kids out and invest safely for them, I guess.

Wealth is one of the bigger reasons I start thinking about my conscience and my 'code'. And I'm not some Dexter psychopath (I don't think Dexter is a psychopath at all btw), but I think a code/course of action you can rely on is helpful. It also makes you think about how your perceive and interact with the world around you.
