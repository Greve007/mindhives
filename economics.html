<h3><a href="economicsarticle1.html">Why wealth distribution is getting worse</a></h3>
This is the first economics article on Mindhives. I find the distribution of wealth inside local communities interesting, however this is getting worse due to the modernization of commercial trade. Such as buying a clothing from the other side of the world instead of from a local community.
