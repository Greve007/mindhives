<h1>Local and community wealth is decreasing</h1>
<br><br><p>
Local communities are rapidly decreasing their wealth and local businesses are failing.
<br><br>
We are actively transferring our wealth to large businesses and corporations. This is a modern problem in the global trade. 
<br><br>
I wanted to mention this idea, because I have seen many small businesses go bankrupt or stop, since it was obvious the market wasn't sustainable. 
<br><br>
What I am discussing is not negative blood between countries. But I will explain how supporting local businesses will result in higher local wealth. Whereas supporting non-local businesses results in a decrease in local wealth.
<br><br>
Western countries have been trading internationally for centuries and is one of the main reasons (later alongside the industrial revolution) that made them so powerful and wealthy in the first place (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_revolution">reference 1</a>, <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w26865">reference 2</a>). However, this also created wealth inequality, like the VOC. The Dutch became very wealthy, although Indonesians stayed relatively poor. 
<br><br>
Now trade is becoming more equal. Products from Asia are still cheap. But when Asia's wealth goes up, product prices will also rise. 
<br><br>
The problem I am sketching lies in community driven wealth. e.g. buying milk from the milkman, instead of a large supermarket chain. So we're basically failing our local businesses. (More on this down below)
<br><br>
More European- and Americans are buying Asian cars. What happens is that Western car brands get a smaller financial annual return. In other words, the Western car brands are slowly losing power in the market. 
<br><br>
If we buy more products from another continent, Western countries will face wealth depression. Money goes out of the region, but it's not coming back. Again in other words, we are actively transferring our wealth to another region! You could view it as buying a carpet from a big chain, instead of your friend who crafts carpets with his hands. <br>
Yes, it might cost more, but the wealth stays inside a group or circle, as it may. 
<br><br>
We are failing our local businesses by ignoring their products. This results in higher prices for not even that better a product. <br>
The same happened with wool products. Synthetic clothing is way cheaper, which cascaded into nobody buying wool (that is somewhat more expensive, but also more durable), slowing wool productions and spiralling into wool products becoming incredibly expensive. Just because wool is produced less. 
This is also a reason why family businesses can be really successful if organised correctly. You provide a place to work for each other, while also expanding the skills in your business. <br>
One such group of people who are known for doing this very well are Jewish people. Family businesses, asking each other for favours and trading with one another saves a lot of time, energy, money and even tax.
<br><br>
We should stay aware of the fact that some products cannot be bought locally due to not having the materials for it. However most products can be made locally. e.g. Toys, cars, food*, chairs.
<br><br>
<i>*Extra note for food
If you are Asian, your body will be better adjusted for Asian foods. While Europeans are adjusted for European foods. Just like the soil. Banana peels will take years to compost in European soils, whereas apples compost only in days.</i> 
<br><br>
So to conclude this article, I will remind you that local wealth mainly exists due to trade within local communities. Modern international trade gives countries and individuals opportunities to grow. However due to the decrease in local trade, this can cascade into wealth inequalities. 
<br><br>
Buy local if you can!
