<h2>Crypto is becoming mainstream</h2>Decentralisation has become mainstream with a massive crypto market estimated a little under 3 trillion dollars as of 2026. Of course, with this enourmess market cap it is getting more attention from large businesses and even governments. 
<br><br>See, crypto is like a stock, but totally different. It is digital currency, however mostly used as an investment that is upturned. So in the public eye it is not digital currency, but an asset that grows in value. The problem with this wrong interpretation, is that governments are thinking crypto should be taxed. (I completely disagree btw). I am swapping my fiat currency for a different currency (crypto) that I trust will keep its value, unlike fiat, which inflates every year. 
<br><br><h2>Monero as digital cash</h2>In early 2026 Monero (XMR) spiked! Even before this happened Hydragon09 was hooked on Monero and now I understand him. It is fully open-source, but the transactions are completely private. Monero acts like digital cash. Paying with cash is 100% legal, as long as the seller pays tax on the product. So why can my digital transactions not be encrypted and private? This is what Monero does and it is totally justified if you ask me.
<br><br>Europe has banned Monero from centralised exchanges in the EU, such as Kraken and Binance. So why is physical cash not banned??? It is practically the same, but one is physical and the other is digital. This goes to show that "Monero is too powerful" - Hydragon09. 
<br><br>Why this matters to me: Web3 or decentralisation of the web and DeFi are an upcoming technology, a step up in the currencies. First we traded products, then we used shells, after that society transitioned into bronze, silver & gold, and now we use fiat, a centralised currency that is restricted to a country or region. Currency has essentially become more centralised and controlled.
<br><br><h2>Digital age</h2>We are now in the digital age and geographical borders are slowly dissolving. We are becoming decentralised and it is looking like crypto might become the future currency.

<br><i>This is how currencies have evolved through the centuries.</i>
<br><br>As our society transitions from fiat into crypto, a question arises. How do we hold each other accountable for tax and illegal activity? Maybe a decentralised legal transaction verifyer, through Proof-of-Stake? Holding each other accountable for transactions linked with illegal activity is an interesting but hard question and might be important for the future.
<br><br>All in all, I think DeFi is in an awkward financial state, and together with the mainstream perspective it will take a long time before crypto is realised as a legitimate and everyday currency.
