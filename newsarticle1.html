<h2>Mindhives' first article</h2>
<p>
This is the first article on Mindhives, or whatever the html website will be called in the future. The goal of this website will be to share our experiences, interests and insights upon various subjects. 
<br><br>Let me define 'our'. I'm talking about Greve007 and Hydragon09 (our GitHub names). We are deep and complex thinkers on life, health, technology and whatever else you can think of. 
<br><br>We have had the thought of creating a blog like this for some time, but it never really got into action. I recently saw two websites, which hooked me by their nerdy design. We could make this too, so I looked up a video on HTML basics. 
<br><br>Now the website is live and running through GitHub and this is its first article.
