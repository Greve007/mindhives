<h1>Expanding Mindhives</h1>
<br>
<p>
<h3>Introducing new topics</h3>
I'm adding two new topics: Health and economics.
<br><br>
Hydragon will write more about health, since he is learning and trying out health supplements like creatine and eating more fish. Furthermore, I want to write a little about economics, like the reason why communities can create a lot of wealth. 
<br>
I also want to learn how I can make links from Mindhives embedded. So that you have a picture with a description when you link Mindhives in X (twitter) or Discord. That would be cool to have as an addition. 
<br><br>
Small additional update. A new university period just started (this period is a lot of fun) so I might be less active on socials and developing the blog on Mindhives. But it's HTML so don't expect impressive stuff here. 
<br><br>Also, which title setup do you like more 1 or 2?
